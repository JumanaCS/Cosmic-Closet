# 🩰 About Cosmic Closet

Cosmic Closet is a **social e-commerce platform** for buying and selling used, vintage, and repurposed items. What makes it unique is the ability for users to create and share outfits from the items they're selling, blending fashion inspiration with sustainable shopping.

### The Problem

The fashion industry faces significant challenges:
- **Fast Fashion Waste** — Millions of garments end up in landfills yearly
- **Fragmented Resale Market** — Existing platforms lack community and creativity
- **No Outfit Inspiration** — Buyers struggle to visualize how items work together
- **Limited Social Features** — Resale apps feel transactional, not personal

### The Solution

Cosmic Closet addresses these challenges by providing:
- **Outfit Creation Tools** — Sellers can style and showcase items together
- **Social Commerce** — Follow sellers, like outfits, build community
- **Sustainable Shopping** — Give pre-loved items a second life
- **Visual Discovery** — Browse by outfit, not just individual items
