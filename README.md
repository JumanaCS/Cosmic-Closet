## ü§é StartUp UNO
Cosmic Closet was submitted to the local UNO Startup competition. Out of nearly 40 applications, our team was selected as one of the 8 teams allowed to attend seminars and receive mentorship for the project. After the seminars, 5 teams will be chosen to pitch their ideas in the final competition, where a winner will be selected. We were selected to be one of those 5, presented at the finals, and won the Social Innovation Award!
