# ü©∞ About Cosmic Closet
Cosmic Closet is a social e-commerce platform for buying and selling used, vintage, and repurposed items with features allowing users to create outfits from the items they are selling. 

Cosmic Closet addresses the intersection of two growing trends: the resurgence of dress-up games and the increasing demand for sustainable fashion. Traditionally, dress-up games were primarily targeted at young girls, but the landscape has shifted significantly. With the recent success of platforms like "Everskies" and "Dress to Impress", the audience has broadened to include a diverse user base across various demographics. Notably, Dress to Impress has seen explosive growth over the past year, capturing the attention of Twitch streamers and celebrities alike. Influencers such as Caseoh (male) and Madison Beer (female) have not only embraced the platform but have also helped propel its popularity to new heights.

This surge in interest presents a unique opportunity to create an outfit-making app that leverages real clothing, tapping into the excitement surrounding virtual fashion. By allowing users to engage with actual second-hand items in a gamified environment, Cosmic Closet makes sustainable fashion more appealing and accessible. In an era where fast fashion is wreaking havoc on the environment, with entire landfills overflowing with discarded clothing, it‚Äôs crucial to promote more eco-friendly alternatives. Cosmic Closet aims to change the narrative by showing that second-hand fashion can be both fun and fashionable, encouraging more people to make sustainable choices.
